# pretrained-classifier
This repository features an image classifier developed with TensorFlow's Keras API, utilizing the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The classifier is capable of determining whether an image depicts a dog or a cat, harnessing the capabilities of a deep learning model that has been pre-trained on the extensive ImageNet dataset.
# Features
1. Pre-trained MobileNetV2 Model: Utilizes the lightweight and efficient MobileNetV2 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, for image classification.
2. Image Preprocessing: Handles image preprocessing, including resizing and normalization, to match the input requirements of the model.
3. Top-3 Predictions: Outputs the top 3 predictions with associated confidence scores, along with the corresponding labels.
